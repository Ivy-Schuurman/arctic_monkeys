                        <p>Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. The group consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.</p>
                        <p>Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, <em>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em> (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history at the time of its release and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. It won <strong>Best British Album</strong> at the <strong>2007 Brit Awards</strong>. The band's second album, <em>Favourite Worst Nightmare</em> (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won <strong>Best British Album</strong> at the <strong>2008 Brit Awards</strong>. They went on to release <em>Humbug</em> (2009) and <em>Suck It and See</em> (2011).</p>
                        <p>The band's wider international fame came with the success of their critically acclaimed fifth album <em>AM</em> (2013), which was supported by the global hit <em>"Do I Wanna Know?"</em>. It topped four <em><strong>Billboard</strong></em> charts and was certified platinum in the US. At the <strong>2014 Brit Awards</strong>, the album became their third to win <strong>British Album of the Year</strong>. Their sixth album, <em>Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino</em> (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. It received a <stromg>Best Alternative Music Album</strong> nomination at the <strong>Grammy Awards</strong>, their second to do so after <em>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em>. Their seventh album, <em>The Car</em>, was released in 2022 and received nominations for the <strong>Ivor Novello Awards</strong> and the <strong>Mercury Prize</strong> in 2023.</p>

                <p>In the United Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums. The band has won seven <strong>Brit Awards</strong>; winning <strong>British Group</strong> and <strong>British Album of the Year</strong> three times, becoming the first band to ever "do the double" —that is, win in both categories— three times; a <strong>Mercury Prize</strong> for <em>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em>, an <strong>Novello Award</strong> and 20 <strong>NME Awards</strong>. In addition, they have been nominated for six <strong>Grammy Awards</strong>, and received <strong>Mercury Prize</strong> nominations in 2007, 2013, 2018 and 2023. Both <em>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</em> and <em>AM</em> are included in <strong>NME's</strong> and different editions of <strong>Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</strong> lists.</p>

                <h3>My experience</h3>
                    <p>This year on May 5th I went to the Arctic Monkeys concert in the Ziggo Dome, Amsterdam. It was my first concert ever and it was so much fun. I went together with a good friend of mine, and we were so lucky to get tickets. Since the tickets were already sold out when we found out about the concert. We were crazy lucky to get two resale tickets a week before the concert would take place.</p>
                    <p>As a big fan of Arctic Monkeys I can happily say that their concert was amazing and the crowed was lovely. They preformed a big variation of songs, both old and new. This made it so that I discovered so many songs from them that I didn't know before. I'm also happy that the band sounded amazing live as I was scared of what if's, like "what if they don't sound good and my first concert experience is ruined?".</p>
                    <p>Having said that I'm so extremly happy that I was able to experience this concert. I definitely recommend new fans going to the bands concert the next time they'll go on tour.</p>
